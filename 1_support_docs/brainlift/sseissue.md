# Why SSE Isn’t Working and How to Fix It

Below is a detailed walkthrough of why “live” SSE updates might not be making it through and what you can do to fix it. The core issue is that, although your server-side code is emitting SSE lines, Next.js (and certain hosting platforms) often buffers or blocks these chunks by default. In other words, your code is correct in principle, but Next.js needs some extra help to stream incremental data in real time.

---

## 1) The Code Itself Is (Mostly) Right

• You are correctly setting the headers to:
  ```
  "Content-Type": "text/event-stream"
  "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-transform"
  ```
  Then you write valid SSE lines like:
  ```text
  event: someevent
  data: {"some": "payload"}

  ```
  (an extra blank line after the data line).  
• You return a TransformStream (or some form of streaming Response) and close the writer.  
• In principle, that setup normally works for SSE.

**However**, Next.js often buffers these writes unless specifically configured to stream in real time.

---

## 2) The Usual Culprit: Next.js / Vercel Buffering

Because you are on Next.js (App Router) returning a `new Response(...)` from an async function, some environments (for example, Vercel serverless) will buffer the SSE messages until the function finishes.

In short, the user only sees the SSE data after the route handler completes—defeating the purpose of “real-time” streaming.

### Steps to mitigate:

1. **Force Node.js Runtime**  
   In Next.js, add:
   ```ts
   export const runtime = 'nodejs'
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
   ```
   at the top of your route file. The “nodejs” runtime often allows chunk-by-chunk streaming.  

2. **Check Hosting**  
   Make sure your hosting environment supports streaming. If you deploy to Vercel’s serverless function environment, it may not flush partial chunks. Some folks successfully enable streaming by using the “Edge” runtime or a specialized SSR setting, but often you need the “nodejs” runtime to avoid partial buffering.

---

## 3) Check for Early Errors

Sometimes, your code never reaches the part where it sends SSE “task” events because it detects a missing parameter or some other validation error:

ts
if (!bodyParam) {
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing body parameter' }), { status: 400 });
}






If the request fails at that step, you’ll never see any SSE messages.

### What to do:
• Ensure the client is actually passing all required fields.  
• Log server output to confirm that the code path is reaching your SSE streaming logic.

## 4) SSE in Next.js Best Practices

1. Mark the route for Node.js:
   ```ts
   export const runtime = 'nodejs'
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
   ```
2. Return a `ReadableStream` with `controller.enqueue(...)` rather than a `TransformStream`, which sometimes requires extra care. For example:
   ```ts
   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

   export const runtime = 'nodejs';
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

   export async function GET(req: Request) {
     const encoder = new TextEncoder();

     return new Response(
       new ReadableStream({
         async start(controller) {
           controller.enqueue(
             encoder.encode("event: ping\ndata: {}\n\n")
           );
           controller.close();
         },
       }),
       {
         headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
           'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
           'Connection': 'keep-alive',
           'X-Accel-Buffering': 'no',
         },
       }
     );
   }
   ```
3. Keep your route dynamic and do not rely on build-time or static rendering for SSE.  
4. Test locally to confirm the SSE lines appear one by one. Then deploy and watch logs carefully.

---

## 5) Verify No Silent Failures

If an unhandled exception occurs before ANY SSE lines are written, you will never see partial data. Check:

- **try/catch** blocks that might skip the SSE output.  
- **Server logs** to see if an error is thrown before streaming begins.  

If the error is thrown too early, you’ll never get to the SSE logic.

---

## 6) Client-Side EventSource Setup

- Confirm that you see “message” or “task” events in the JavaScript console.  
- If the client never triggers these callbacks, your SSE connection might be failing or never establishing.  

**Pro tip**: use the Network tab in your browser’s dev tools to see if the SSE stream is open and if partial chunks are arriving.

---

## How to Fix It

Here is a condensed checklist:

1. At the **top** of your `route.ts` (or `route.js`):
   ```ts
   export const runtime = 'nodejs'
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
   ```
2. Switch from a `TransformStream` to a `ReadableStream` with `controller.enqueue()` for each SSE event.  
3. Wrap logic in proper `try/catch` to ensure you do not exit prematurely.  
4. Ensure you do not do a `return new Response(...)` before you start streaming.  
5. Check your production logs or local logs to confirm whether you are hitting the SSE writing lines.  
6. If deploying on Vercel or similar, confirm that SSR streaming is enabled and not blocked by buffering.

---

## Summary

If you still see no updates in real time, it almost certainly means Next.js or your hosting environment is buffering SSE writes. To fix this, force the Node.js runtime, confirm in logs that you are indeed writing SSE lines as tasks complete, and ensure your environment supports partial flushes.

Once you enable streaming properly, you should see your “task” events and partial SSE messages appear in the client’s console as they happen, and your TaskTrackingModal should display each new task result live.
