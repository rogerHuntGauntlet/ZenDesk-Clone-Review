## Implementation Notes

### Langsmith Integration
- Project Name: outreach-crm-ai
- Environment Variables:
  ```
  LANGSMITH_TRACING_OUTREACH=true
  LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT_OUTREACH="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
  LANGSMITH_API_KEY_OUTREACH="your-api-key"
  LANGSMITH_PROJECT_OUTREACH="outreach-crm-ai"
  ```
- Tracing Implementation:
  - Use LangChainTracer for all chain operations
  - Tag traces with relevant categories (e.g., "outreach", "test")
  - Include metadata for message context and type
  - Monitor chain performance and token usage

### Best Practices
- Always use project-specific environment variables
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Tag all traces for easy filtering and analysis
- Include relevant metadata in traces for debugging
- Monitor token usage and response times
- Regular review of trace data for optimization
