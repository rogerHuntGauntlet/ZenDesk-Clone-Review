What's one of the most time-consuming parts of customer engagement? Crafting personalized, context-aware messages that strike the right tone and include relevant details. While template emails exist, they often feel generic and miss important context from the customer journey. This is where OutreachGPT transforms your communication workflow. 


Imagine this: You need to reach out to several students about their upcoming academic review. Instead of copying and pasting templates, you click the OutreachGPT icon and say "Draft a check-in email for James Chen, mentioning his recent achievements and remind him about our academic planning session next week." The system crafts a personalized message that pulls relevant details from his CRM record, matches your staff member’s tone, and includes specific talking points based on his academic journey.


OutreachGPT turns communication from a manual chore into an intelligent partnership. Instead of starting each message from scratch or using rigid templates, OutreachGPT generates thoughtful drafts that consider the student's full context – their academic performance, extracurricular involvement, past interactions, and upcoming milestones. The system doesn't just merge basic fields; it understands relationships between different aspects of the student's journey to create truly personalized communications. Each draft can be reviewed and edited before sending, and the system learns from your modifications to better match your communication style over time.


This feature maintains the personal touch of customer engagement while dramatically reducing the time spent on communication tasks. You can batch-generate personalized messages for groups of customers while ensuring each one feels individually crafted. OutreachGPT also suggests optimal sending times based on past engagement patterns, tracks response rates, and learns which communication styles are most effective for different types of customers and situations. It even helps maintain consistent communication frequency by proactively suggesting when it's time to check in with customers you haven't contacted recently.

Agent Accuracy Metrics
To pass Week 2, you must track any 2 of the following metrics and showcase your evaluation process on LangSmith/LangFuse in your walkthrough video: 


Success rate at identifying the correct action
Accuracy of field updates
Speed of response
Error rates and types


If for any reason, you need to use a custom metric that better matches your AI features, feel free to. If you are unsure on what that custom metric might be, reach out to staff for assistance. 


How to approach manual evaluation in your AI CRM applications for any accuracy-related metric: 


Document 20-30 common requests you'd actually make to your CRM system. Make sure to include both simple tasks ("update this grade") and complex ones ("draft a progress report based on the last three assessments").
For each request in your test dataset, document the expected outcome. 
What exact changes should appear in the database?
Which fields should be modified?
What should the response look like?
Any specific formatting or content requirements?
Create structured test cases:
Input: The user's request
Expected Output: The specific changes that should occur
Context: Any additional information needed
Success Criteria: How to determine if the action was correct, probably human-driven for this project
Set up LangSmith/LangFuse for monitoring:
Create a new project for your CRM features
Set up traces to track each request
Enable detailed logging of inputs/outputs
Manually run systematic tests:
Test each case multiple times
Vary the phrasing slightly
Test with different contexts
Document any failures or unexpected behaviors
Track key metrics manually:
Success rate at identifying the correct action
Accuracy of field updates
Speed of response
Error rates and types


o1 feedback: 


It calls methods like determineTone(context) or formatInteractionHistory(context.interactions). If `context.interactions` or `context.prospect` is missing or undefined, you might get runtime errors such as “Cannot read properties of undefined.”

### How to fix:
• Ensure all required fields in OutreachContext are at least stubbed out (e.g., empty arrays for messages).  
• Double-check that each interface property is populated and spelled correctly.

## 4. Issues Invoking LangSmith API

Even if you set environment variables, your local network or firewall might block requests to "https://api.smith.langchain.com," causing network errors or timeouts.

### How to fix:
• Verify you can reach the LangSmith endpoint from your machine.  
• Check firewall/VPN settings or proxy configurations.  
• Confirm environment variables and that you’re using the correct API endpoint.

---

## 5. Import or Usage Errors

Sometimes, project setups fail when:
• You import EnhancedOutreachService incorrectly, or  
• You use it in a purely client-side context that lacks environment variables.

Ensure that:
• Your build environment is suited for server-side Node usage (especially with Next.js & environment variables).  
• The code references process.env in a location that is only executed server-side.

---

## Steps to Debug Locally

1. Create or update your .env/.env.local with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT_OUTREACH="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSMITH_API_KEY_OUTREACH="YOUR-LANGSMITH-API-KEY"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSMITH_PROJECT_OUTREACH="outreach-crm-ai"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR-OPENAI-KEY"
   ```
2. Log your environment variables (e.g., console.log(process.env)) before initializing EnhancedOutreachService to confirm they exist.  
3. Optionally, disable tracing:
   ```typescript
   const service = new EnhancedOutreachService(false);
   ```
4. Inspect the error stack trace. Common errors can be:
   • "Missing required environment variables"  
   • "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'messages')"  
   • Network or fetch errors calling LangSmith/OpenAI  
5. If it’s a shape error, log the context you pass to generateAndTrackMessage:
   ```typescript
   console.log(JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));
   ```
   Ensure each property matches the OutreachContext interface.  
6. Verify your @langchain library versions and ensure no mixing of ESM vs. CommonJS modules.

---

## Conclusion

Most local failures of EnhancedOutreachService.ts stem from:

1. Missing environment variables for LangSmith or OpenAI.  
2. Passing incomplete or undefined data for the "context" object.  
3. Network or import misconfigurations.

By verifying these items—especially the environment variables—and checking how you invoke generateAndTrackMessage, you can typically resolve local runtime errors.
