# Wireframes

This folder contains the wireframes and design assets for the project.

## Purpose
- Document the structure and layout of the platform.
- Serve as a reference for the development team during implementation.

## What to Include
- Screenshots or files from V0 (e.g., `.png`, `.pdf`).
- Annotations or notes for each screen/page.
- User flow diagrams or sitemaps.

## Best Practices
- Organize files by date or screen name for clarity.
- Use consistent naming conventions for files (e.g., `home_screen_v1.png`).
