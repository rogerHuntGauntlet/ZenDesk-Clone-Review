# Deployment (deploy)

This folder contains deployment configurations and scripts.

## Purpose
- Automate the process of deploying the platform to AWS or other hosting services.
- Provide infrastructure setup instructions.

## What to Include
- AWS configurations (e.g., `cloudformation.yaml`).
- Scripts for deployment (e.g., `.sh` or `.bat` files).
- Environment variable templates (e.g., `.env.example`).

## Best Practices
- Secure sensitive information (e.g., use `.gitignore` for `.env` files).
- Test deployment scripts thoroughly before production.
- Document the deployment process clearly.
