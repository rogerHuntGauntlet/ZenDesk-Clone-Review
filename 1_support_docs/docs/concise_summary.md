This describes requirements for building AutoCRM, an AI-enhanced customer relationship management system. The project spans two weeks: Week 1 focuses on building the baseline ticket management system, while Week 2 integrates AI capabilities.
The baseline system requires core features like:

A comprehensive ticket data model capturing customer interactions
API-first design for integration and automation
Employee interface for queue/ticket management
Administrative controls for team management
Customer portal with self-service tools
Multi-channel support across devices

The AI enhancements in Week 2 include:

LLM-generated responses for tickets
RAG-based knowledge management
Automated ticket routing and analysis
Human-in-the-loop workflows
Multi-channel support (phone, chat, email)
AI-powered system monitoring and reporting

Key technical decisions include using Supabase for backend infrastructure, Lovable + Cursor for development, and AWS Amplify 2.0 for deployment. The project emphasizes AI-optimized code organization over traditional human-centric patterns.
Deliverables include comprehensive documentation (Brainlifts), a video walkthrough demonstrating the system, and a Git repository with production-grade code and testing. The goal is to minimize human workload in customer support while maintaining high-quality service.
