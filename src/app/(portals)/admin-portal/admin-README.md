  - View project statistics and ticket counts
  - Monitor project status and progress

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure admin login
  - Role-based access control
  - Session management

- **Dashboard**

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Independence**
   - All components MUST be built within this directory
   - DO NOT share components with other portals
   - Maintain separate styling and business logic

2. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for local state
   - Implement custom hooks for shared functionality
   - Keep state management isolated from other portals

3. **API Integration**
   - All API routes should be prefixed with `/api/admin`
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include authentication checks

4. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
   - Follow the admin portal's specific design system
   - Maintain separate style configurations

## Current Status

- âœ… Basic project listing and viewing
- âœ… Project status management
- ðŸš§ User management interface
- ðŸš§ Advanced analytics dashboard
- ðŸ“… Ticket management system (Planned)

## Security Considerations

- All routes must verify admin credentials
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Log all administrative actions
- Regular security audits of admin functionalities

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to `/admin-portal/login`
2. Use admin credentials to access the portal
3. Access the dashboard at `/admin-portal/dashboard`

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Create components within the appropriate subdirectory
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Update this documentation as needed
4. Add proper TypeScript types
5. Include error handling
